The color of the discharged light is usually based composition and condition of the semi conducting substance applied, and can be infrared, visible or near-ultraviolet. In the year 1955 Rubin Braunstein of the Radio Corporation of America initially accounted on infrared release from gallium arsenide and various supplementary semiconductor alloys.</p>                                                                                               <h6>Benefits of LED Lights</h6>                                                <p>Following are the major advantages which LED lights posses as compared to traditional incandescent bulbs and compact fluorescent lights.</p><h5>Long Lasting</h5><p>LED bulbs last up to 10 times as long as compact fluorescent and far longer than typical incandescent bulbs.</p><h5>Durable</h5><p>Since LEDs do not have filament, they are not damaged under circumstances when a regular incandescent bulb would be broken. Because of their durability, LED bulbs hold up well to jarring and bumping.</p><h5>Cool</h5><p>LED bulbs do not cause heat build- up; LED produces 3.4 btu's/hour, compared to 85 for incandescent bulbs. This also cut down on air conditioning costs in homes &amp;offices.</p><h5>Mercury Free</h5><p>No Mercury is used in the manufacturing of LEDs.</p><h5>More Efficient</h5><p>LED light bulbs use only 2-10 watts of electricity (1/3rd to 1/30th of incandescent or CFL).Small LED flashlight bulbs will extend battery life 10 to 15 times longer than incandescent bulbs. Also, because there bulbs lasts for years, energy is saved in maintenance and replacement costs. For example, many cities in the US are replacing their incandescent traffic lights with LED arrays because the electricity cost can be reduced to 80% or more.</p><h5>Cost Effective</h5><p>Although LEDs are expensive, the cost is recouped over time due to energy savings, lower maintenance and replacement costs.</p><h5>Lights for Remote Areas</h5><p>Because of the low power requirement for LEDs, using solar panels becomes more practical and less expensive than running an electric line or using a generator for lightning.</p><h4>COLORS OF LED LIGHTS</h4><h5>Red</h5><p>Red is the traditional color for maintaining night vision.</p><h5>Green</h5><p>Green is now the preferred color of pilots and military. The green color is also great for retaining night vision, and it does not erase the red markings on maps and charts.</p><h5>Blue</h5><p>Many people like the blue because it is very easy on the eyes. Blue appears to be good reading light forelderly eyes. Elderly folks report that they can read under the blue light for hours without eyestrain, compared to severe eyestrain in less than 30 minutes with incandescent lightning.</p><h5>White</h5><p>White is the most popular of the LED colors. It produces a soft white light, without harsh reflection, glare or shadows.</p><h5>Amber</h5><p>LED amber bulbs do not attract flying insects, as do ordinary white bulbs. Amber LEDs are used outdoors in areas such as patios and decks wher insects flying around lights are a nuisance.</p>                                                                                              </div>                                                      <?php echo $page_long_description; ?> <div class="apply_now" ><a href="energiesform.php"><img src="images/apply_now_btn.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive"/></a></div>                                        </div>	                                                                                              </div>                                            </div>                                          </div>                                        </div>                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <?php include "includes/footer.php";?>
